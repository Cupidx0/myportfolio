    <h2>Learn About Cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. They are used to remember information about the user, such as login status, preferences, and other session-related data. Here are some key concepts about cookies that a user should learn:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Setting a Cookie:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cookies are set using the <code>document.cookie</code> property in JavaScript.</li>
                <li>A cookie consists of a name-value pair, and optionally, attributes like expiration date, path, domain, and secure flag.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Expiration Date:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cookies can have an expiration date, after which they are automatically deleted by the browser.</li>
                <li>If no expiration date is set, the cookie is considered a session cookie and is deleted when the browser is closed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Path Attribute:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The path attribute specifies the URL path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the cookie header.</li>
                <li>By default, the path is set to the current document location.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reading a Cookie:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cookies can be read using <code>document.cookie</code>, which returns all cookies in a single string.</li>
                <li>Parsing this string is necessary to extract individual cookie values.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Deleting a Cookie:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>To delete a cookie, set its expiration date to a past date.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
